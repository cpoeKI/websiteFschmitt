This is the initial commit of what I would like to dedicate some of my time in the upcoming future.

Throughout my career so far, I had the opportunity to work on several different environments, across multiple industries and on all kinds of company stages. I have worked as a **freelance**, on **startups**, **software house**, **financial consulting** and **tech consulting**. In these different environments I managed to work on different positions, **Junior**, **Mid**, **Senior Software Engineer**, **Lead Engineer**, **Senior Consultant** and **Engineering Manager**.

Have always managed to work not only on different company's culture, but also on different cultural settings, as I've worked and lived in **5 different countries** (visited 75). As well as working together with **remote teams** around the globe. 

Therefore, I have decided to share my thoughts, within this blog, on a great range of topics, mostly about the following:

- Software Development
- Engineering & Product
- Leadership
- Venture building
- Culture

Ocasionally might write some entries regarding other topics that are also part of my interests, such as **Product Design**, **Photography** and **Traveling**.

Feel free to also check out my [500px](https://500px.com/fsschmitt), reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/schmittfelipe) if you would like to debate a bit more about any of the topics I write here.
